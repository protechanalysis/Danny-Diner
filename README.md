**This repository hosts the solutions for Week 1 of the 8 Weeks SQL challenge by DannyMa.** [Challenge_page](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)

## Introduction
Danny's strong passion for Japanese cuisine led him to venture into the restaurant business early in 2021. He courageously established a charming eatery specializing in his top three dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. In this endeavour, Danny's Diner has accumulated fundamental operational data during its initial months. However, as a data analyst, I'm now sought to assist the restaurant in leveraging this data to optimize its operations and ensure its sustainability. The challenge lies in transforming this raw data into actionable insights that can guide decision-making and ultimately contribute to the success of Danny's Diner.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
- sales
- menu
- members

### Case Study Questions and Solutions


1.  What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
